To compile multiple times, it can be done by using a .bat file
It are an example of this approach in the tiny project.

Or it can be done in this way:
- On CMD
- Open the current folder with c++ files
- run the following command
	g++ main.cpp module.cpp -o main.exe
		where:
		main.cpp: main file
		module.cpp: dependencie function cpp file
		-o main.exe: compiled file output name
	(if have multiple dependencies file, just add it
	 separated by spaces)
	g++ main.cpp mod1.cpp mod2.cpp modn.cpp -o main.exe
- then, run the main.exe file created to run the script
